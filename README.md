# Geometric Modeling, Transformation, and Stress Analysis

## 1. Geometric Modeling

### Types of Geometric Modeling

Geometric modeling in CAD (Computer-Aided Design) involves the representation of objects in different forms, each suited for specific tasks. The three main types are:

- **Wire-frame Modeling**:
  - Wire-frame models are created using points, lines, and curves, without defining the surface or volume.
  - It represents only the skeleton of the object.
  - **Use case**: Early stages of design, visualizing basic shapes, and structures without surface or volume details.

- **Surface Modeling**:
  - Surface modeling creates a skin over the object, representing its outer boundaries but not the internal volume.
  - **Use case**: Creating complex surfaces like car body designs or airplane wings, where surface detail is critical.

- **Solid Modeling**:
  - Solid modeling defines the volume, surface, and mass properties of the object.
  - It provides a complete representation, including dimensions, mass, and internal structure.
  - **Use case**: Final product design for manufacturing, providing full details for stress analysis and manufacturing processes.

## 2. Transformation
